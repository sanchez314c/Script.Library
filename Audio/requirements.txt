# Installation Notes
# ==================
# 
# 1. Automatic Installation:
#    All scripts will automatically install required dependencies
#    when run for the first time. No manual installation needed.
#
# 2. Manual Installation:
#    To install all dependencies at once:
#    
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 3. Virtual Environment (Recommended):
#    Create an isolated environment for these scripts:
#    
#    python3 -m venv audio-scripts-env
#    source audio-scripts-env/bin/activate
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 4. System Dependencies:
#    Some functionality requires external tools:
#    
#    # Install FFmpeg for audio conversion
#    brew install ffmpeg
#    
#    # Install Homebrew if not already installed
#    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#
# 5. macOS Specific:
#    PyObjC frameworks are only needed on macOS for enhanced integration.
#    They will be automatically skipped on other platforms.
#
# 6. Troubleshooting:
#    If you encounter installation issues:
#    
#    # Upgrade pip first
#    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
#    
#    # Clear pip cache
#    python3 -m pip cache purge
#    
#    # Force reinstall problematic packages
#    pip install --force-reinstall package_name
#
